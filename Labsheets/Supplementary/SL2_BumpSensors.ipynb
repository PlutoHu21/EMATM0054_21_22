        "The bump sensors operate in the same manner as the line sensors, with a few minor operational differences.  However, instead of measuring `infra-red` (IR) light reflected from the ground surface, reflected IR light is measured off the two flexible plastic segments (bumpers) at the front of the 3Pi+ robot. As these plastic segments are depressed against the 3Pi+ body, the quantity of reflected light reduces.\n",

It is important to note that in the above plot, we can clearly see that the two sensors perform very differently.  On the plot, a green dotted line marks where both sensors have been depressed fully (against the 3Pi+ body).  Despite both bump sensors having roughly the same range of motion, and the same electronic parts, we can see that the timing characteristics are very different.  \n",
