        "**`Odometry`** refers to maintaining an estimate of position using sensors.  By using a last-known position and a subsequent measurement of change, it is possible to calculate an estimate of the robot position.  This technique is known as **`dead reckoning`**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The real e-puck robot utilises `stepper motors`, and this has been simulated in Webots. `Stepper motors` increment their position by fixed angular quantity. When using `stepper motors` to effect changes of position, they can be conveniently regarded to simultaneously encode rotation.  This is achieved by counting the number of times the `stepper motor` has been commanded to increment by one angular position.  This assumption is only true when the motor has enough `torque` to effect the rotation - otherwise, the microcontroller will count rotations in software that did not happen in reality.  \n",

This would mean your robot appeared to have an intelligent autonomous behaviour.  It is important to recognise that to achieve this, your robot was utilising a `source of information` from the environment - the line.\n",

        "\n",
        "**For the line following challenge, the simple kinematic model provided is sufficient to enable your robot to travel back to where it started with reasonable performance.  The exercises in this section can be considered optional or suitable for further work.**  \n",
        "\n",
        "In the simple model detailed in this labsheet, we have worked with the assumption that the robot will move or rotate, exclusively (either one or the other). As such, our model translates by some amount $X_{R}$ and then rotates this translation motion by some $\\theta_{R}$.  These operations are accounted for by the following motor activations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- when left and right motors have equal non-zero velocity and in the same direction, $v_{l} = v_{r} \\ne 0$, the robot will move forwards or backwards in a straight line.\n",
        "- when the left and right motors have equal non-zero and inversed velocity, $v_{l} = -v_{r} \\ne 0$, the robot will rotate on the spot.\n",
        "\n",
        "This presents the exceptional case when the left and right motor are of different velocity, including cases where one my be 0.  Under these conditions, the robot will move on an arc. \n",
        "\n",
        "In our simplified model, we assume that travel on an arc can be sufficiently approximated by the integrating the rotation of the straight line segments generated by $X_{R}$.  \n",
        "\n",
        "When the wheels have differing velocity, the point of rotation for the movement moves away from point $p$.  This new point of rotation is referred to as the `instantaneous centre of rotation` (ICR).  The more similar the wheels speeds, the further the ICR moves from point $p$.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. As a matter of interest:\n",
        "  - **Hypothesise:** If the ICR moves away from point $p$, and so defines an arc of travel for the robot, will the simplified model under-estimate or over-estimate the resultant position in comparison?\n",
        "2. Implement ICR and the kinematic update routine. \n",
        "  - If you need help with this exercise, discuss the matter with the teaching staff. They will help you to decide if you should insatead continue further with labsheets and come back to this later.\n",
        "  - When working on this implementation, be aware of divide-by-zero errors.\n",
        "  - Any gain in performance from this implementation is likely to be more pronounced and visible when you address the full line following challenge, especially the return to home objective.  Therefore, you may need to return to this exercise later.  \n",
